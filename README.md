## Description

This is an Amazon-like storefront which will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 








As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.
